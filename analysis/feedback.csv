12,Hope the AI will not be sexist or racist
19,{EM_SLIGHTLY_SMILING_FACE}
28,Nothing:)
47,Lisa is nice a smart girl :)
49,It was pretty fun and the first time I actively looked something up about AI. I dont know how I did but thanks for the experience 
51,"Easy to follow. 
If possible cut extent of instruction 
People are lazy "
61,"sometime hard to differentiate between ""do you think the AI recognized X"" and ""do you think the AI recognizing X was justified in this case""?"
65,Good luck with the experiment!
69,"to be honest, for me, it was more of a guessing, than having an imagination of possibilities of KI"
70,Make the intro easier to understand. Its a bit much to wrap ones head around quickly
74,Good to outcome in the future 
78,"Based on my knowledge of image recognition and adversarial attacks, it is really hard to judge if the images were classified correctly. Knowing the decision, the coloring and explanation might be helpful to understand the reasons for a correct or incorrect classification. However, without knowing the classification, it relay can be hard because even if distinctive and descriptive features might have been used for the classification, it still can be very wrong."
80,"Good explanation s, nice samples"
82,Put the back button also at the top
83,"That was an amazing test, I tried to focus on colored parts of pictures, but still not sure if I was wrong. Btw, good luck to the authors, they did an amazing job! "
87,"The highlighted areas were important to understand WHY it categorizes certain pictures the way it does. If it categorizes a black plastic circle as a ""lens cap"" by the name ""Canon"" on the cap, then that is understandable and desirable. If it recognizes fur coat by the woman wearing it, then it does not make sense."
92,Nice
95,It was helpful for me bcz i gonna work on xai for my phd thesis and i need to read this kind of article.thank you so much.plz if possible write about xai in image quality assessment.
111,"Very interesting, thanks "
114,"It would be helpful to know, if the AI model was actually trained on data as specific as e.g. water tank or boathouse. "
116,"Were these random images? I had the feeling these were especially difficult images to classify for an AI, as most objects were obscured or in unusual positions / contexts / backgrounds. I think this might bias the results of the AI and also of the rater! (Grias de Strolls :D)"
120,You should specify faces of dogs if several dogs Are shown in one picture 
121,"I guess, my interpretation is mostly based on the assignability of the object itself. That means, if I was able to certainly recognise the object, I was rather sure the AI was also able to."
123,"It was a pleasure, to try to think as KI and the computer."
127,Hard to understand for people without any experience in AI.
