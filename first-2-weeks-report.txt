Done:
* tried out vgg16 and alexnet models + applied gradcam methods on both
                            (pytorch implementation, pretrained on imagenet)
Doing:
* extracting confidence scores of model predictions
* preparing images for the model to classify in batch
Plans:
* look for a survey tool that can shuffle questions
* look for pictures that would be negatively classified (the biggest challenge for now imho)
Problems:
*
*
Open Questions:
* latex template - stick to ieee template or any scientific one works?
* pictures for survey - from the same dataset or any?

Meeting Notes:
confidence score

post-hoc anti-hoc explanation before or after the decision

shortcut model
